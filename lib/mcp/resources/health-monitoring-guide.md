# Health Service Monitoring Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive information about monitoring health services and endpoints in production environments.

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### Response Time
- **Average Response Time**: Track the mean response time across all requests
- **95th Percentile**: Monitor the 95th percentile response time for performance outliers
- **99th Percentile**: Track extreme performance cases

### Availability
- **Uptime Percentage**: Monitor service availability over time
- **Error Rate**: Track the percentage of failed requests
- **MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)**: Measure how quickly issues are resolved

### Resource Utilization
- **CPU Usage**: Monitor CPU consumption patterns
- **Memory Usage**: Track memory allocation and garbage collection
- **Disk I/O**: Monitor disk read/write operations
- **Network I/O**: Track network traffic and bandwidth usage

## Monitoring Tools

### Prometheus
- Time-series database for metrics collection
- Powerful query language (PromQL)
- Excellent for alerting and visualization

### Grafana
- Visualization and dashboard platform
- Integrates well with Prometheus
- Customizable dashboards and alerts

### Custom Health Checks
- Implement `/health` endpoints
- Database connectivity checks
- External service dependency checks
- Resource availability verification

## Best Practices

1. **Set Appropriate Thresholds**
   - Define clear alerting thresholds
   - Use different severity levels (warning, critical)
   - Implement escalation procedures

2. **Monitor Dependencies**
   - Track external API calls
   - Monitor database connections
   - Check third-party service availability

3. **Implement Circuit Breakers**
   - Prevent cascade failures
   - Graceful degradation
   - Automatic recovery mechanisms

4. **Log Aggregation**
   - Centralized logging system
   - Structured log formats
   - Real-time log analysis

## Alerting Strategies

### Immediate Alerts
- Service down
- High error rates (>5%)
- Critical resource exhaustion

### Warning Alerts
- Response time degradation
- Memory usage trends
- Disk space warnings

### Escalation Procedures
1. **Level 1**: Automated recovery attempts
2. **Level 2**: On-call engineer notification
3. **Level 3**: Management escalation

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Set up monitoring infrastructure
- [ ] Configure health check endpoints
- [ ] Implement metrics collection
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Set up alerting rules
- [ ] Test alerting procedures
- [ ] Document runbooks
- [ ] Train operations team

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Alert Fatigue**: Too many non-critical alerts
2. **Insufficient Context**: Alerts without enough information
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Not monitoring external services
4. **Poor Thresholds**: Inappropriate alerting thresholds
5. **No Runbooks**: Missing incident response procedures
