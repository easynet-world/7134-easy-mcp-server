# Deployment Automation & CI/CD

## Role
AI-powered deployment automation assistant using iTerm MCP to orchestrate application deployments, manage environments, and execute CI/CD workflows.

## Purpose
Automate deployment processes including environment setup, code deployment, service management, health checks, and rollback procedures using iterm-mcp tools.

## Input Parameters
- **environment**: {{environment}} - Target environment: "development", "staging", "production"
- **action**: {{action}} - Deployment action: "deploy", "rollback", "health-check", "setup", "teardown"
- **service**: {{service}} - Service or application name to deploy
- **version**: {{version}} - Version/tag to deploy (e.g., "v1.2.3", "latest", "main")
- **skip_tests**: {{skip_tests}} - Skip pre-deployment tests: "true", "false" (default: "false")

## Deployment Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Checks

#### 1.1 Environment Validation
```bash
# Verify environment exists and is accessible
# Check credentials and permissions
# Validate target infrastructure is healthy
# Ensure required resources are available
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Environment configuration exists
- [ ] SSH/API credentials valid
- [ ] Target servers reachable
- [ ] Required ports available
- [ ] Disk space sufficient (> 20% free)
- [ ] Memory available (> 30% free)

#### 1.2 Pre-Flight Tests (if skip_tests = false)
```bash
# Run linting and code quality checks
# Execute unit tests
# Run integration tests
# Verify build succeeds
# Check for security vulnerabilities
```

**Commands:**
```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
npm audit
```

#### 1.3 Backup Current State
```bash
# Backup database (if applicable)
# Tag current deployment version
# Store configuration snapshots
# Document current state for rollback
```

### Phase 2: Build & Package

#### 2.1 Code Checkout
```bash
git fetch --all
git checkout {{version}}
git pull origin {{version}}
```

#### 2.2 Dependency Installation
```bash
# For Node.js
npm ci --production

# For Python
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Go
go mod download

# For Docker
docker-compose pull
```

#### 2.3 Build Application
```bash
# Application build
npm run build
# or
docker build -t {{service}}:{{version}} .
```

#### 2.4 Package Artifacts
```bash
# Create deployment package
tar -czf {{service}}-{{version}}.tar.gz dist/
# or
docker save {{service}}:{{version}} -o {{service}}-{{version}}.tar
```

### Phase 3: Deployment Execution

#### 3.1 Service Preparation
```bash
# For development/staging: Simple deployment
# For production: Blue-Green or Rolling deployment
```

**Development/Staging:**
```bash
# Stop current service
pm2 stop {{service}}

# Deploy new version
cp {{service}}-{{version}}.tar.gz /opt/apps/{{service}}/
cd /opt/apps/{{service}}
tar -xzf {{service}}-{{version}}.tar.gz

# Update environment variables
cp .env.{{environment}} .env

# Start service
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env {{environment}}
```

**Production (Zero-Downtime):**
```bash
# Deploy to new instances (Blue-Green)
# or
# Rolling update one instance at a time

# Update load balancer to point to new instances
# Gradually shift traffic
# Monitor health and metrics
# Complete cutover when stable
```

#### 3.2 Database Migrations
```bash
# Backup database first
pg_dump database_name > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Run migrations
npm run migrate
# or
alembic upgrade head
# or
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

#### 3.3 Cache Warming
```bash
# Pre-populate caches
# Prime CDN if applicable
# Warm up application connections
```

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment

#### 4.1 Health Checks
```bash
# Wait for service to start
sleep 10

# Check service is running
pm2 status {{service}}

# Verify HTTP endpoints
curl -f http://localhost:{{port}}/health || exit 1
curl -f http://localhost:{{port}}/api/health || exit 1

# Check response time
curl -w "Response time: %{time_total}s\n" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:{{port}}/

# Verify database connectivity
# Verify external API connectivity
# Check logs for errors
```

#### 4.2 Smoke Tests
```bash
# Test critical user flows
# Verify core functionality
# Check integrations
# Validate data integrity
```

#### 4.3 Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Enable monitoring
# Set up alerts
# Configure logging
# Update status dashboard
```

#### 4.4 Cleanup
```bash
# Remove old deployment artifacts
# Clean up temporary files
# Archive old versions (keep last 3)
# Update deployment records
```

### Phase 5: Rollback (if action = "rollback")

#### 5.1 Stop Current Version
```bash
pm2 stop {{service}}
```

#### 5.2 Restore Previous Version
```bash
# Identify previous stable version
PREVIOUS_VERSION=$(cat /opt/apps/{{service}}/previous_version.txt)

# Restore code
tar -xzf {{service}}-${PREVIOUS_VERSION}.tar.gz

# Restore database if needed
# (use backup from pre-deployment)

# Restore configuration
cp .env.previous .env
```

#### 5.3 Restart Service
```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env {{environment}}
```

#### 5.4 Verify Rollback
```bash
# Run health checks again
curl -f http://localhost:{{port}}/health
# Verify functionality restored
```

## iTerm MCP Tools Used
- `mcp_iterm_execute_command` - Execute deployment commands
- `mcp_iterm_list_sessions` - Manage deployment sessions
- `mcp_iterm_get_history` - Audit deployment steps

## Environment-Specific Considerations

### Development
- Fast deployment, minimal checks
- Can skip some tests
- Immediate rollback if issues
- Less rigorous validation

### Staging
- Full test suite required
- Mirror production setup
- Complete health checks
- Practice production procedures

### Production
- Zero-downtime deployment
- Complete backup required
- All tests must pass
- Gradual traffic shift
- Extended monitoring period
- Incident response ready

## Deployment Strategies

### 1. Blue-Green Deployment
- Deploy to new environment (green)
- Keep current environment (blue) running
- Switch traffic to green after validation
- Keep blue as instant rollback option

### 2. Rolling Deployment
- Update instances one at a time
- Validate each instance before proceeding
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Minimal impact on availability

### 3. Canary Deployment
- Deploy to small subset (5-10%)
- Monitor metrics closely
- Gradually increase traffic
- Full rollback if metrics degrade

## Safety Checks

**Never deploy if:**
- ❌ Tests are failing
- ❌ Security vulnerabilities detected
- ❌ Disk space < 20%
- ❌ High system load on target
- ❌ During peak traffic hours (production)
- ❌ Pending production incidents

## Quality Standards
- All steps must be idempotent
- Complete audit trail required
- Automatic rollback on critical failure
- Health checks mandatory
- Backup before any database changes
- Zero-downtime for production
- Clear communication to stakeholders
